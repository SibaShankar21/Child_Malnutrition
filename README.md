# Child_Malnutrition

Objective of the Project
The primary objective of this project is to analyze malnutrition data to identify the major patterns and trends of malnutrition in children under five globally and to propose data-driven solutions to reduce malnutrition levels. The specific objectives are:

To collect and analyze malnutrition data from reliable sources.
To identify the primary types of malnutrition affecting children under five.
To understand the temporal and spatial trends of malnutrition.
To develop predictive models for future malnutrition levels based on current data.
To propose actionable solutions and policy recommendations to mitigate malnutrition.

Data Sources Used
The project will use malnutrition datasets from the following sources:

Kaggle: The "Malnutrition across the globe" dataset, which includes data on stunting, wasting, underweight, and overweight in children under five.
Government Websites: Datasets from governmental organizations and health departments.
World Health Organization (WHO): Global reports and guidelines on child malnutrition.
UNICEF: Data and reports on child nutrition and health.
Features
The key features of the dataset will include:

Location: Geographic coordinates and names of countries.
Pollutants: Levels of various malnutrition indicators such as stunting, wasting, underweight, and overweight.
Time: Temporal data including the year of data collection.
Demographic Data: Age, gender, and other relevant demographic information.
Tool for Analysis
The following tools and technologies will be used for data analysis:

Python: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Jupyter Notebooks: For documenting the analysis process and visualizations.
Scikit-learn: For developing predictive models and machine learning algorithms.
Plotly: For creating interactive visualizations.
Tableau: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations to present the findings.
Hypothesis
The hypothesis of the project is that improving access to healthcare, education, and food security will lead to a significant reduction in malnutrition levels in children under five over the next decade. Additionally, specific temporal and spatial trends in malnutrition can be identified and addressed through targeted interventions.

Methodology
The project will be conducted in the following phases:

Data Collection:

Gather malnutrition data from the aforementioned sources.
Compile demographic and other relevant data to support the analysis.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
Standardize data formats and integrate datasets from different sources.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Perform descriptive statistical analysis to understand the distribution and variability of malnutrition indicators.
Visualize temporal trends (yearly, monthly) and spatial distributions using charts and maps.
Source Identification:

Use correlation analysis and regression models to identify potential causes of malnutrition.
Analyze the impact of different factors (e.g., economic status, healthcare access) on malnutrition levels.
Predictive Modeling:

Develop machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, random forest) to predict future malnutrition levels based on historical data.
Validate and test the models using appropriate metrics.
Solution Development:

Based on the analysis, propose solutions such as improving access to healthcare, education, and food security.
Assess the feasibility and potential impact of these solutions.
Reporting and Presentation:

Compile the findings into a comprehensive report.
Create visualizations and interactive dashboards to present the results.
Develop policy briefs and recommendations for stakeholders.
Probable Outcome
The expected outcomes of the project are:

Comprehensive Analysis: A detailed analysis of malnutrition data identifying key trends and patterns of malnutrition in children under five.
Predictive Models: Reliable models for predicting future malnutrition levels and assessing the impact of potential interventions.
Actionable Solutions: Data-driven solutions and policy recommendations to reduce malnutrition.
Impact Assessment: Evaluation of the potential impact of proposed solutions on achieving SDG 3.
Awareness and Engagement: Increased awareness among policymakers and the public about the sources and impacts of malnutrition, and the benefits of proposed interventions.
By addressing malnutrition through data analysis and evidence-based solutions, this project will contribute to creating healthier and more resilient communities, aligning with the objectives of SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being.
